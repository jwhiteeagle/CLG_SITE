          Jake has been painting miniatures professionally for over a decade,
          running Chief Live Gaming as a home-based commission studio. He
          specializes in painting models for Warhammer 40k, Age of Sigmar,
          Dungeons & Dragons, and Kingdom Death Monster. Jake loves painting
          armies and large projects, but also enjoys working on one-off models
          and studio pieces. To get in touch about a project, check out the
          Commissions page!
